NAME
       seq - print a sequence of numbers

SYNOPSIS
       seq [OPTION]... LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST

DESCRIPTION
       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for short
       options too.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              use printf style floating-point FORMAT

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If FIRST or INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That  is,  an
       omitted  INCREMENT  defaults  to  1 even when LAST is smaller than
       FIRST.  The sequence of numbers ends when the sum of  the  current
       number  and  INCREMENT  would  become  greater  than LAST.  FIRST,
       INCREMENT, and LAST are  interpreted  as  floating  point  values.
       INCREMENT  is  usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and
       INCREMENT is usually negative  if  FIRST  is  greater  than  LAST.
       INCREMENT  must not be 0; none of FIRST, INCREMENT and LAST may be
       NaN.  FORMAT must be suitable for printing one  argument  of  type
       'double'; it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are
       all fixed point decimal numbers with maximum precision  PREC,  and
       to %g otherwise.
