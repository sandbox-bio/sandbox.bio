Bowtie 2 comes with some example files to get you started. The example files are not scientifically significant; we use the **Lambda phage reference genome** simply because it's short, and the reads were generated by a computer program, not a sequencer. However, these files will let you start running Bowtie 2 and downstream tools right away.

Type <Execute command={"ls"} inline={true} /> in the command line to see the two sample `FASTQ` files.

We preloaded the Lambda phage reference genome into your sandbox, and stored the path in the variable `$REF` for convenience: <Execute command={"echo $REF"} inline={true} />
