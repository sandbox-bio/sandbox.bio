MD5SUM(1)                     User Commands                     MD5SUM(1)

NAME
       md5sum - compute and check MD5 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       md5sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print or check MD5 (128-bit) checksums.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read MD5 sums from the FILEs and check them

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

       -z, --zero
              end  each  output  line  with NUL, not newline, and disable
              file name escaping

   The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --ignore-missing
              don't fail or report status for missing files

       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       --strict
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in RFC  1321.   When  checking,
       the  input should be a former output of this program.  The default
       mode is to print a line with checksum, a space, a character  indi‐
       cating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where binary is
       insignificant), and name for each FILE.

       Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode  on
       GNU systems.

BUGS
       Do  not  use  the  MD5  algorithm  for  security related purposes.
       Instead, use an  SHA-2  algorithm,  implemented  in  the  programs
       sha224sum(1),  sha256sum(1),  sha384sum(1),  sha512sum(1),  or the
       BLAKE2 algorithm, implemented in b2sum(1)
