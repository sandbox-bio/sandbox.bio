NAME
       comm - compare two sorted files line by line

SYNOPSIS
       comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

DESCRIPTION
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

       With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains
       lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to  FILE2,
       and column three contains lines common to both files.

       -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)

       -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)

       -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)

       --check-order
              check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all input
              lines are pairable

       --nocheck-order
              do not check that the input is correctly sorted

       --output-delimiter=STR
              separate columns with STR

       --total
              output a summary

       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.

EXAMPLES
       comm -12 file1 file2
              Print only lines present in both file1 and file2.

       comm -3 file1 file2
              Print lines in file1 not in file2, and vice versa.
