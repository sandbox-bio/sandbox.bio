              select only these fields;  also print any  line  that  con‐
              tains no delimiter character, unless the -s option is spec‐
              ified

       -n     with -b: don't split multibyte characters

       --complement
              complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields

       -s, --only-delimited

       Use  one,  and  only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of
       one range, or many ranges separated by commas.  Selected input  is
       written  in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly
       once.  Each range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       -M     from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field
