TAIL(1)                       User Commands                       TAIL(1)

NAME
       tail - output the last part of files

SYNOPSIS
       tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print  the  last  10  lines of each FILE to standard output.  With
       more than one FILE, precede each with a  header  giving  the  file
       name.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options  are  mandatory  for short
       options too.

       -c, --bytes=[+]NUM
              output the last NUM bytes; or use -c +NUM to output  start‐
              ing with byte NUM of each file

       -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
              output appended data as the file grows;

              an absent option argument means 'descriptor'

       -F     same as --follow=name --retry

       -n, --lines=[+]NUM
              output  the  last NUM lines, instead of the last 10; or use
              -n +NUM to output starting with line NUM

       --max-unchanged-stats=N
              with --follow=name, reopen a FILE which has not

              changed size after N (default 5) iterations to  see  if  it
              has  been  unlinked  or  renamed (this is the usual case of
              rotated log files); with inotify,  this  option  is  rarely
              useful

       --pid=PID
              with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never output headers giving file names

       --retry
              keep trying to open a file if it is inaccessible

       -s, --sleep-interval=N
              with  -f,  sleep  for approximately N seconds (default 1.0)
              between iterations; with inotify and --pid=P, check process
              P at least once every N seconds

       -v, --verbose
              always output headers giving file names

       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       NUM  may  have  a  multiplier  suffix:  b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB
       1000*1000, M 1024*1024, GB 1000*1000*1000, G  1024*1024*1024,  and
       so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K,
       MiB=M, and so on.

       With --follow (-f), tail defaults to following the  file  descrip‐
       tor, which means that even if a tail'ed file is renamed, tail will
       continue to track its end.  This default behavior is not desirable
       when you really want to track the actual name of the file, not the
       file descriptor (e.g., log rotation).  Use --follow=name  in  that
       case.   That  causes  tail  to  track the named file in a way that
       accommodates renaming, removal and creation.
