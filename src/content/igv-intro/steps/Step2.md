##### Colors

IGV displays the sequence of letters in a genome as a sequence of colours (e.g. A = green, C = blue, etc.).

This makes repetitive sequences, like the ones found at the start of this region, easy to identify.

Zoom in a bit more using the + button to see the individual bases of the reference genome sequence.

You can navigate to a gene of interest by typing it in the same box the genomic coordinates are in and pressing Enter/Return. Try it for your favourite gene, or `BRCA1` if you cannot decide.
