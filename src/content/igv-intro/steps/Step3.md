##### Gene model

Genes are represented as lines and boxes. Lines represent intronic regions, and boxes represent exonic regions.

The arrows indicate the direction/strand of transcription for the gene. When an exon box become narrower in height, this indicates a UTR.

When loaded, tracks are stacked on top of each other. You can identify which track is which by consulting the label to the left of each track.
