This lab will introduce you to the <Link href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">Integrative Genomics Viewer</Link> (IGV), one of the most popular visualization tools for High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data.

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Visualize a variety of genomic data
- Quickly navigate around the genome
- Visualize read alignments
- Validate SNP/SNV calls and structural re-arrangements by eye

There are a few thought-provoking <span class="text-info">**Questions**</span> or <span class="text-primary">**Notes**</span> pertaining to sections of the lab. These are optional, and may take more time, but are meant to help you better understand the visualizations you are seeing.
