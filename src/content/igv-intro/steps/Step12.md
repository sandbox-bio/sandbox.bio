	**Notes**

    * This is a position where an AluY element causes mis-alignment.
    * Misaligned reads have mismatches to the reference, and well-aligned reads have partners on other chromosomes where additional ALuY elements are encoded.
    * Zoom out until you can clearly see the contrast between the difficult alignment region (corresponding to an AluY) and regions with clean alignments on either side.
