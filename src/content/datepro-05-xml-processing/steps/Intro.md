This is the **fifth tutorial** in a series that will demonstrate how shell scripting can be used to perform the tasks that health and life science specialists may need to undertake to find and retrieve biomedical data and text. We will use the compound caffeine as an example and explore different public repositories to identify diseases related to it. The focus is not on the specific relationships we may discover, but on the process of obtaining them.

The objective of this tutorial is to learn XML data handling techniques using shell scripting, in order to search, filter, and extract information from the XML files, which in our case contain information characterizing a protein.
