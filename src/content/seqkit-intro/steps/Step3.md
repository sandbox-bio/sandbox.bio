The `seqkit seq` command is used to extract, filter and format your FASTA and FASTQ files.

For example, to extract the sequence names from a FASTA file:

<Execute command="seqkit seq --name hairpins.fa | head" />

If your FASTA is formatted such that the sequence name contains an ID followed by a space and more information, then you can extract just those IDs using `--only-id`:

<Execute command="seqkit seq --name --only-id hairpins.fa | head" />

If you are interested in only sequences of a certain size, e.g. >300bp, use the `--min-len` to filter out shorter sequences:

<Execute command="seqkit seq --min-len 300 hairpins.fa  | seqkit stats" />

You can also filter out long sequences with `--max-len`, and for FASTQ files, you can filter out reads with a certain average quality with `--min-qual` and `--max-qual`.
