Say you're studying the microRNA `miR-34a` and you want to extract its sequence in humans, you can use SeqKit's `grep` command:

<Execute command="seqkit grep --pattern 'hsa-mir-34a' hairpins.fa" />

To load sequences in bulk, SeqKit can read sequence IDs from a text file. For example, the file `ids.txt` contains the IDs of miR-34a across 5 species:

<Execute command="cat ids.txt" />

To extract those sequences from `hairpins.fa`, use the `-f` flag:

<Execute command="seqkit grep -f ids.txt hairpins.fa" />

    💡 This is a useful tool because the alternative ways to achieve this on the command line would be more challenging. You could try using good-old `grep` but that only matches the sequence name line. You could use `grep -A2` to also retrieve the sequence, but that assumes all sequences have 2 lines, which they do not.
