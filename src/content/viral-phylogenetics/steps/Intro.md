Welcome to the Viral Phylogenetics tutorial!

In this tutorial, you will perform a viral phylogenetics analysis on real viral sequences. You will seek to identify when the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) existed by learning the three fundamental steps in phylogenetic analysis: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), Phylogenetic Inference, and Rooting/Dating. 

At the end, you'll have the opportunity to embark on your own phylogenetic exploration of the HIV-1. Welcome aboard!
