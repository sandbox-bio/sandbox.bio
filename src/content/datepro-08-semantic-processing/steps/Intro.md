This is the **eighth and last tutorial** in a series that will demonstrate how shell scripting can be used to perform the tasks that health and life science specialists may need to undertake to find and retrieve biomedical data and text. We will use the compound caffeine as an example and explore different public repositories to identify diseases related to it. The focus is not on the specific relationships we may discover, but on the process of obtaining them.

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the world of semantics, and present step-by-step examples to enhance text and data processing by using semantics. The goal is to equip the reader with the basic set of skills to explore semantic resources that are nowadays available using simple shell script commands.
