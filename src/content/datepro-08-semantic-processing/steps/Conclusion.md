This concludes the **Unix Shell** tutorial adapted from the same section of the [Data and Text Processing for Health and Life Sciences](https://labs.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/book/) book.

In this tutorial, we learned how to use XML parsing techniques to explore the semantics encoded in biomedical ontologies, which can be used to create lexicons that can then be used to recognize relevant entities in text.

And this concludes our tutorial series. I hope you found it valuable, and please feel free to contact me if you notice any typos or have suggestions for future additions.
