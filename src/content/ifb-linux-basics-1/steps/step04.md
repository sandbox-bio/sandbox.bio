Using a Bash shell, you will be able to write and execute Unix commands.
A Unix command is made of distinct parts: a **command name** and, if needed, **options** and **arguments**.

The space character is mandatory to separate all these elements (command name, options and arguments).
You may now understand why a space in a file or a directory name is a very bad idea within an Unix environment.

Be very careful while writing your Unix commands: lowercases and uppercases are not the same!
Unix commands are usually in lowercase.

Now, type the following command in your terminal and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

<Execute command="date" />
