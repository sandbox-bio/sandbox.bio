The Bash shell provides you with a working space including files and directories.

A very useful command is `ls`, that **l**i**s**ts the content of a directory.
In your Unix terminal on the right, type `ls` and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The Bash shell should display `Data` that is a directory named `Data`.

Now, type the following command in your terminal (and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>) :

<Execute command="ls Data" />

The Bash shell should display the 8 files included in the `Data` directory.

Remarks:

- Pay attention to the space character between `ls` and `Data`
- Don't forget to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run commands
- `ls` is the command **name**
- `Data` is a directory name and an **argument** of the `ls` command

## Options

Options modify the way in which a command works.
In Bash, shell options start with a simple or double dash (`-` or `--`).

For example, we can display the size of the files using the `--size` option of the `ls` command.
Lets try and type:

<Execute command="ls --size Data" />

Now, the 8 files are displayed with their respective sizes (in blocks).

You can use a short form for this option by replacing `--size` (long form) by `-s` (short form).

Usually we also use the `-h` option to display sizes in more **h**uman readable formats (_e.g._ 1K, 234M, 2G).

You can use several options in the same command.

You can merge short form options using a single dash as prefix.
