We will use the bedtools implementation of a Jaccard statistic to measure the similarity of two datasets. Briefly, the Jaccard statistic measures the ratio of the number of _intersecting_ base pairs to the _total_ number of base pairs in the two sets. As such, the score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0; lower values reflect lower similarity, whereas higher values reflect higher similarity.

Let's walk through an example: we would expect the Dnase hypersensivity sites to be rather similar between two samples of the **same** fetal tissue type. Let's test:

<Execute command={"bedtools jaccard \\ -a fHeart-DS16621.bed \\ -b fHeart-DS15839.bed"} />

But what about the similarity of two **different** tissue types?

<Execute command={"bedtools jaccard \\ -a fHeart-DS16621.bed \\ -b fSkin-DS19745.bed"} />

Hopefully this demonstrates how the Jaccard statistic can be used as a simple statistic to reduce the dimensionality of the comparison between two large (e.g., often containing thousands or millions of intervals) feature sets.
