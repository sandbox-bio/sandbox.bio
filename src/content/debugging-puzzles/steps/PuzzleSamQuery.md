You just finished aligning sequencing data using your favorite read aligner, which output the file `alignments.bam`:

<Execute command="samtools view alignments.bam" />

Although you can view the entire file, you want to extract alignments to specific genomic coordinates.

But you get an error when you run the following `samtools` command:

<Execute command="samtools view alignments.bam ref2:10-11" />

**Your Goal**: Create a file `alignments.fixed.bam` from the alignments in `alignments.bam` so that the following query does not give an error:

<Execute command="samtools view alignments.fixed.bam ref2:10-11" />

<Exercise {criteria} {hints} />
