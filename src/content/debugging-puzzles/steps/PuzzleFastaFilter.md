Here's a fasta file that contains various sequences from the human genome and you want to know how many sequences are in the file:

<Execute command={"head sequences.fa"} />

Each FASTA record starts with a `>`, and you can assume those carets are not seen anywhere else in the record.

Naturally, you reach for good old `grep` and find lines that contain `>`. Easy peasy--click below to run the command:

<Execute command={"grep > sequences.fa"} />

That's odd, you were expecting to see lines containing `>`, not the `grep` command usage output.

Oups, we lost the data in `sequences.fa`:

<Execute command={"cat sequences.fa"} />

The file is empty, but don't worry, we can regenerate the data easily (not always the case in real life!):

<Execute command={`${curl} > sequences.fa`} />

**Your Goal**: Find the correct `grep` command that outputs lines containing `>`. Save the output as `sequences.txt`
