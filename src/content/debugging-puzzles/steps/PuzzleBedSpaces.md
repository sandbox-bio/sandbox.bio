You just received a file from your collaborator: `exons.bed`, which contains a list of exonic regions. As part of your analysis, you would like to merge all overlapping regions into contiguous intervals.

This is a perfect job for `bedtools merge`, **but** you keep getting an error when you run the following command:

<Execute command={"bedtools merge -i exons.bed"} />

**Your Goal**: Create a file `exons.fixed.bed` from the regions in `exons.bed` so that the following query does not give an error. Use the search and replace command `sed` for making changes to the file.

<Execute command={"bedtools merge -i exons.fixed.bed"} />
