Welcome!

During this course, you will discover files and folders organization in Unix and learn some new Bash commands.

The left panel contains explanations and guides to run Unix commands. Use the right panel to type command examples and experiment as you wish.

During the course, some instructions will be explained. They will appear in the left panel on a grey background (<code class="lang-bash" style="background: #f6f8fa; font-size: 90%; padding: 2px 5px;">like this example</code>) and must be typed in the right panel. You could modify them, but in order to answer questions or quizzes, we advise you to copy the proposed instructions exactly as they are.
