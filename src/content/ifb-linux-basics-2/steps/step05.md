When used without argument, the `cd` command will set the current working directory to your HOME directory.
This HOME directory is the place where a user may store their files.

```bash
cd
pwd
```

The symbol for the HOME directory is `~` (tilde). This character can be accessed under a PC keyboard using <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>. With a Mac OSX keyboard, it may be accessed using <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd>.

In the example below we successively go to the `/tmp` then `/root/test` directories:

```bash
cd /tmp
pwd
cd ~/tutorial/test
pwd
```

However, note that the HOME directory is not always the right place to store large files (particularly on a cluster with shared resources).
Ask your administrator!

To answer the next question, please type the 3 following commands:

```bash
cd /root/tutorial/nr
cd ~/tutorial/test
cd
```
