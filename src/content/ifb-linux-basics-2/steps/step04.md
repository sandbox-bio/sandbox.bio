The `cd` command (**c**hange **d**irectory) can be used to visit another directory in the file tree.
The target directory must be specified using an absolute or a relative path.

To experiment with the `cd` command, run the following commands:

```bash
ls
cd /root/tutorial/nr
ls
cd ../homo_sapiens
ls
```

Could you guess the absolute path of your current working directory?

Verify the answer with `pwd`.

## Automatic completion

To go from your current working directory to a target directory, you must specify names of all intermediate directories. This can be time-consuming if the target directory is far away from your current directory.
The key <kbd>Tab</kbd> triggers auto-completion. It means you just need to type the first letters of a directory, then <kbd>Tab</kbd>, to get its full name. If there is more than one file or directory starting with the same letter, auto-completion will complete the name as far as it can. If you type a second time <kbd>Tab</kbd>, auto-completion will show you the available options.

The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key is perhaps the most used key in Unix!

Use the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key and `cd` to go into the `/root/tutorial/bos_taurus/UMD3.1/star-2.7.2b/` directory.
