import Execute from "$components/Execute.svelte";

To bring up the help, just type <Execute command={"samtools"} inline />

As you can see, there are multiple "subcommands" and for samtools to work, you must tell it which subcommand you want to use.

Examples:

- <Execute command={"samtools view"} inline />
- <Execute command={"samtools sort"} inline />
- <Execute command={"samtools depth"} inline />
