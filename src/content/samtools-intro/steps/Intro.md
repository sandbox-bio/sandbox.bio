> This tutorial is an interactive version of the <Link href="http://quinlanlab.org/tutorials/samtools/samtools.html">samtools tutorial</Link> developed by the <Link href="http://quinlanlab.org/">Quinlan Lab</Link>. The contents are the same, but the data was subsampled so it can be analyzed in your browser.

Our goal is to work through examples that demonstrate how to explore, process and manipulate SAM and BAM files with the `samtools` software package.

For future reference, use the samtools <Link href="http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html">documentation</Link>.
