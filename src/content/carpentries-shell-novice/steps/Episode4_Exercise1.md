We have already met the `head` command, which prints lines from the start of a file.
`tail` is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.

Consider the file `exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv`.
After these commands, select the answer that
corresponds to the file `animals-subset.csv`:

```bash
$ head -n 3 animals.csv > animals-subset.csv
$ tail -n 2 animals.csv >> animals-subset.csv
```
