</script>

Go to the folder `exercise-data/`:

<Execute command="cd ~/tutorial/exercise-data/" />

Write a shell script called `longest.sh` that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory with that extension. For example:

```
bash longest.sh alkanes pdb
```

would print the name of the `.pdb` file in `alkanes/` that has the most lines.

Feel free to test your script on another directory e.g.

```
bash longest.sh writing txt
```
