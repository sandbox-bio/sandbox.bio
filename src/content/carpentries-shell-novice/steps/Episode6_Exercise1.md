Go to the folder `exercise-data/`:

<Execute command="cd ~/tutorial/exercise-data/" />

Leah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this:

```
2013-11-05,deer,5
2013-11-05,rabbit,22
2013-11-05,raccoon,7
2013-11-06,rabbit,19
2013-11-06,deer,2
2013-11-06,fox,1
2013-11-07,rabbit,18
2013-11-07,bear,1
```

An example of this type of file is given in `animal-counts/animals.csv`.

We can use the command `cut -d , -f 2 animal-counts/animals.csv | sort | uniq` to produce the unique species in `animals.csv`. In order to avoid having to type out this series of commands every time, a scientist may choose to write a shell script instead.

Write a shell script called `species.sh` that takes any number of filenames as command-line arguments and uses a variation of the above command to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of those files separately.
