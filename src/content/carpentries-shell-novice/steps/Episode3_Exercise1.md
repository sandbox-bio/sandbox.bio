After running the following commands,
Jamie realizes that she put the files `sucrose.dat` and `maltose.dat` into the wrong folder.
The files should have been placed in the `raw` folder.

<Execute command="ls -F" />

<Execute command="ls -F analyzed" />

<Execute command="cd analyzed" />

Fill in the blanks to move these files to the `raw/` folder
(i.e. the one she forgot to put them in)

```bash
$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ____/____
```

<Exercise {criteria} />
