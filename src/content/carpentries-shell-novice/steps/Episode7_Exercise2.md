Go to the folder `exercise-data/`:

<Execute command="cd ~/tutorial/exercise-data/" />

Leah has several hundred data files saved in one directory, each of which is formatted like this:

```
2012-11-05,deer,5
2012-11-05,rabbit,22
2012-11-05,raccoon,7
2012-11-06,rabbit,19
2012-11-06,deer,2
2012-11-06,fox,4
2012-11-07,rabbit,16
2012-11-07,bear,1
```

She wants to **write a shell script that takes a species as the first command-line argument and a directory as the second argument**. The script should return one file called `<species>.txt` containing a list of dates and the number of that species seen on each date. For example using the data shown above, `rabbit.txt` would contain:

```
2012-11-05,22
2012-11-06,19
2012-11-07,16
```

Below, each line contains an individual command, or pipe. Arrange their sequence in one command in order to achieve Leahâ€™s goal:

```
cut -d : -f 2
>
|
grep -w $1 -r $2
|
$1.txt
cut -d , -f 1,3
```
