During the COVID-19 pandemic, obtaining viral genome sequences from samples collected from patients or the environment (e.g. wastewater) enabled public health officials to track the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 over time, identify mutations of interest/concern, and detect the prevalence and growth of new viral lineages as the pandemic progressed. Because a high-confidence reference genome sequence was obtained very early on in the pandemic, researchers were able to perform "amplicon sequencing": a highly-targeted approach for sequencing specific pre-known regions of interest across the viral genome.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to reconstruct a "consensus" genome sequence from a given SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing dataset.
