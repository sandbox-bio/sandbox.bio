<Alert>
If you are working with larger genomes with multiple chromosomes each, check out the <Link href="https://circa.omgenomics.com/app/plot/gallery/aligned_genomes">aligned genomes gallery example in Circa</Link>, which includes a few additional instructions on how to set up the reference file for those cases.
