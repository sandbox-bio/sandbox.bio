<script>
import Execute from "$components/Execute.svelte";
</script>

We can now update our script file from previous tutorials: 

<Execute command="nano getproteins.sh" />

To contain the following lines:

<pre class="code border p-2" style="white-space: pre-wrap">
ID=$1 # The CHEBI identifier given as input is renamed to ID
rm -f chebi\_$ID\_*.xml # Removes any previous files
cat chebi\_$ID\_xrefs_UniProt_relevant_identifiers.csv | \
xargs -I &lcub;&rcub; curl -o chebi\_$ID\_&lcub;&rcub;.xml 'https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/&lcub;&rcub;.xml' 
</pre>

#### Variable

We should note that the last line now includes the `xargs` and `curl` commands, and the `$ID` variable. This new variable is created in the first line to
contain the first value given as argument (`$1`). So, every time we mention
`$ID` in the script we are mentioning the first value given as argument. This
avoids ambiguity in cases where `$1` is used for other purposes.Since the preceding 
character of `$ID` is an underscore (`_`), we have to add a backslash (`\`)
before it. The second line uses the rm command to remove any files that were
downloaded in a previous execution. We also now added two comments after
`#` character, so we humans do not forget why these commands are needed
for.

To execute the script once more:

<Execute command="chmod u+x getproteins.sh" />

<Execute command="./getproteins.sh 27732" />

And again, to check the results:

<Execute command="head -n 1 chebi_27732_*.xml | less" />
