Note that `awk` automatically initializes variables for you, so `sum = 0` is not strictly necessary (but preferable for clarity):

<Execute command={`awk -F "\\t" ' \\ { if($3 == "Chicken Bowl") sum += $2 } \\ END { print(sum) }' orders.tsv`} />

As a side note, `awk` doesn't actually need a file to work on if you only provide it with a `BEGIN` statement and no body:

<Execute command={`awk 'BEGIN{ print(5/7) }'`} />

(that's one easy way to do floating-point math on the command line, as Bash itself only supports integers).
