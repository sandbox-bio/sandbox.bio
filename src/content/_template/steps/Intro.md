Our goal is to work through examples that demonstrate how to explore, process and manipulate genomic interval files (e.g., `BED`, `VCF`, `BAM`) with the `bedtools` software package.

Some of our analysis will be based upon the [Maurano et al.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6099/1190) exploration of DnaseI hypersensitivity sites in hundreds of primary tissue types.

This tutorial is merely meant as an introduction to whet your appetite. There are many, many more tools and options than presented here. We therefore encourage you to read the [bedtools documentation](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
