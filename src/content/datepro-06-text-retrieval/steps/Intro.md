This is the **sixth tutorial** in a series that will demonstrate how shell scripting can be used to perform the tasks that health and life science specialists may need to undertake to find and retrieve biomedical data and text. We will use the compound caffeine as an example and explore different public repositories to identify diseases related to it. The focus is not on the specific relationships we may discover, but on the process of obtaining them.

The objective of this tutorial is to learn how to automatically retrieve scientific publications associated with proteins and extract text from their titles and abstracts. Additionally, you will learn how to identify and recognize diseases mentioned within the text.

This tutorial is part of a series of tutorials adapted as interactive versions of the hands-on steps described in the [Data and Text Processing for Health and Life Sciences](https://labs.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/book/) book, which is licensed under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). In general, the contents are the same, but access to data via `curl` is not possible, so the tutorials will use local files.
