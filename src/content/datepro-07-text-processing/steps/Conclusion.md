This concludes the **Unix Shell** tutorial adapted from the same section of the [Data and Text Processing for Health and Life Sciences](https://labs.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/book/) book.

In the next tutorial in this series, we will explore the semantics encoded by biomedical ontologies to more efficiently identify diseases in text.
