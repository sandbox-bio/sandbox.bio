This concludes the **Unix Shell** tutorial adapted from the same section of the [Data and Text Processing for Health and Life Sciences](https://labs.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/book/) book.

In this tutorial, we learned how to use regular expressions and pattern matching techniques to recognize relevant entities in text.

In the next tutorial in this series, we will explore the semantics encoded by biomedical ontologies to more efficiently identify diseases in text.
