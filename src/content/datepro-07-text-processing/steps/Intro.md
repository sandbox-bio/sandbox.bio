This is the **seventh tutorial** in a series that will demonstrate how shell scripting can be used to perform the tasks that health and life science specialists may need to undertake to find and retrieve biomedical data and text. We will use the compound caffeine as an example and explore different public repositories to identify diseases related to it. The focus is not on the specific relationships we may discover, but on the process of obtaining them.

The objective of this tutorial is to learn a step-by-step introduction to how we can process that text using shell script commands, specifically extract information about diseases related to caffeine. The goal is to equip the reader with an essential
set of skills to extract meaningful information from any text.
