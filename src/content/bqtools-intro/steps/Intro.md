Our goal is to work through examples that demonstrate how to create, manipulate, and explore BINSEQ files (e.g. `.bq` and `.vbq`) using the `bqtools` software package.

This will cover the basics of importing/exporting sequencing data into BINSEQ files as well as some useful and common operations that can be performed with `bqtools`.
