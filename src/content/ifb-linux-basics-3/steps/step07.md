## _cut_

The `cut` command cuts out sections from each line of a file and writes the result to standard output.
It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character and field (or columns).

Basically the `cut` command slices the lines to extract some text.
The main use of this command concerns the extraction of columns indicated by their number (first column is number 1).

Columns may be separated by various characters (_e.g._ ',', ';', ':', '|'...). One of the most common is the tabulation ('\t')
as in '.bed' files. This is also the default separator of the `cut` command.

Here is an example on how to extract the 3rd column of the _SAOUHSC.bed_ file:

```bash
cut -f 3 SAOUHSC.bed
```

Multiple columns can be extracted using a comma between two column numbers or a '-' for a range of successive columns.

Try the extraction of the 3 first columns and the 5th one from the _SAOUHSC.bed_ file:

```bash
cut -f 1-3,5 SAOUHSC.bed
```

You can change the delimiter between fields with the _-d_ option.

Look at the beginning of the _MACS2.csv_ file (try `head MACS2.csv`).
It contains 6 columns, separated by a comma.
