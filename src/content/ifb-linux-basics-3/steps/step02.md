## Browse a file interactively

Very often the files you want to read are too large for your screen.
For instance, you have previously displayed the content of the file _SAOUHSC.fasta_ with the `cat` command.

In contrast to `cat`, the `less` command opens a file and and let you browse its content interactively (line by line or page by page):

```bash
less SAOUHSC.fasta
```

Once inside the `less` program, you can use the following keys to navigate through the file:

- <kbd>⬇️</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> : go down one line
- <kbd>⬆️</kbd> : go up one line
- <kbd>space</kbd> : go down one page
- <kbd>B</kbd> : go up one page
- <kbd>G</kbd> : go to the beginning of file
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> : go to the end of file

You can also search through the file you opened with `less` by typing <kbd>/</kbd> followed by the characters you want to search and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
The screen will jump to the first occurrence of the searched item which will be highlighted.
Pressing <kbd>N</kbd> will bring you to the **n**ext occurrence while pressing <kbd>P</kbd> will bring you to the **p**revious occurrence.
To search backwards, you need to use <kbd>?</kbd> instead of <kbd>/</kbd> and then proceed similarly.

Use <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit the `less` command.
